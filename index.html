<h1>SemVer FTW</h1>
<p><a href="https://npmjs.org/">NPM</a> packages specify versions in the semver format: <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> (e.g. <code>3.0.2</code>). </p>
<h2>When Publishing:</h2>
<h2>Major: &quot;breaking changes&quot;</h2>
<p>Increment MAJOR version when you have removed or changed a feature,
and dependent modules will have to modified to be compatible with the new version.</p>
<h2>Minor: &quot;new feature&quot;</h2>
<p>Increment MINOR version when you have added a feature,
but the module is backwards compatible.</p>
<h2>Patch: &quot;bugfix&quot;</h2>
<p>Increment PATCH version when you have fixed a problem,
but not broken or changed anything else.</p>
<h2>the semver spec</h2>
<p><a href="http://semver.org">semver.org</a></p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Suppose a new module called <code>pizza</code> gets published to NPM as version <code>0.0.1</code>. </p>
<p>When the author of the module decides to add some new functions 
like <code>.pepperoni()</code> it should get incremented to <code>0.1.0</code>.</p>
<p>When an issue on github is opened about a bug in <code>.pepperoni()</code> 
and the bug gets fixed it should get pushed as <code>0.1.1</code>.</p>
<p>When the author goes vegetarian and eliminates the <code>.pepperoni()</code>
method it should be published as <code>1.0.0</code>. </p>
<h2>What does 1.0.0 mean?</h2>
<p>there is some disagreement about the best use of <code>0.x.y</code> range semvers.
<a href="https://github.com/dominictarr/semver-ftw/issues/2">see this discussion</a>
I suggest pubishing your module starting at <code>1.0.0</code> and after that,
incrementing the major version on each breaking change.</p>
<p>If you wish to indicate the stability of your module,
do so in the README, in same way that node.js does.
<a href="http://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index">stability index</a></p>
<h2>When Using Published Modules</h2>
<p>Module authors need to take care to correctly express the nature of
changes with their version number, but it is the module user&#39;s responsibility
to request sensible ranges.</p>
<h2>DON&#39;T</h2>
<p>Don&#39;t specify ranges that are too wide. The following may cause npm to install
a version of a dependency that does not work with your module.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">&quot;dependencies&quot; : {
  &quot;anything-goes&quot;:&quot;*&quot;,
  &quot;greater-than&quot;: &quot;&gt;1&quot;,
}</code></pre>
<h2>DO</h2>
<p>It is best to specify modules that you <em>know</em> work.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">&quot;dependencies&quot; : {
  &quot;patches&quot;    :&quot;~1.3.7&quot;,
  &quot;major-minor&quot;:&quot;1.4.x&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>These ranges demand specific module major and minor versions,
but allow patches. If the author of one of these modules publishes a patch,
and it breaks your module (and you where using the module as documented)
Then it was their fault, and you should post an issue.</p>
<h2>Also DO</h2>
<p>This is also good.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">  &quot;exact&quot;      : &quot;3.5.2&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This should never break, however, you will have to update your module
when a patch is released.</p>
<h2>Or even DO</h2>
<p>npm&#39;s default behavior is to install <em>compatible</em> version:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">&quot;dependencies&quot;: {
  &quot;compatible&quot;: &quot;^1.33.7&quot;,
  &quot;major&quot;: &quot;1.x&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>These ranges allow minor changes, including new (non-breaking) features
which could include performance upgrades or othere interesting changes for
your project. It is supposed to be as safe as &quot;~&quot; operator.</p>
