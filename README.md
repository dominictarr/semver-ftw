#SemVer FTW

SemVer is a three part version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

## Major: "breaking changes"
Increment MAJOR version when you have removed or changed a feature, and dependent modules must be updated to use the new version.

## Minor: "new feature"
Increment MINOR version when you have added a feature, but the module is backwards compatible.

## Patch: "bugfix"
Increment PATCH version when you have fixed a problem, but not broken or changed anything else.
